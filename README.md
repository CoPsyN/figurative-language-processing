**A short summary of the paper:**

This paper aims at investigating the behavior of Transformer-based language models (TLMs) in the task of figurative language processing.
We conducted feature importance analyses for 3 TLMs (BERT, RoBERTa, XLM), 
and compared their behaviors with two white-box models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
